## Links
- Links are created using the < a > element. You specify which page you wanted to link to using the href attribute. The text between < a > tag and closing is known as the link text.
- URL stands for uniform resource locator. When linking to other pages within your site, you don't need to speciify the domain name. If all pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the href attribute is just name of the file.
- You can create linka to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.

## Layouts
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or inline box. Block level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of ay layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text.
- Block level elements start on a new line < h1 > < p > < ul > < li >
- Inline elements flow in between surrounding text < img > < b > < i >
- < div > elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning. 
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels.
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

## Functions, Methods, and Objects
- Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task. A method is the same as a function, except methods are created inside (and are part of) an object.
- Objects are made up of properties and methods.
