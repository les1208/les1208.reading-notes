## File and Stream I/O
- File and stream I/O (input/output) refers to the transfer of data either to or from a storage medium. 
In the .NET Framework, the System.IO namespaces contain types that enable reading and writing, 
both synchronously and asynchronously, on data streams and files. 
These namespaces also contain types that perform compression and decompression on files, and types that enable communication through pipes and serial ports.
### Files and Directories
- Here are some commonly used file and directory classes:

* File - provides static methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files, and helps create a FileStream object.

* FileInfo - provides instance methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files, and helps create a FileStream object.

* Directory - provides static methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories and subdirectories.

* DirectoryInfo - provides instance methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories and subdirectories.

* Path - provides methods and properties for processing directory strings in a cross-platform manner.
