### Images (406-427)

- You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS. 
- Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images. <br>
A lot of sites use the same sized image across all their pages.
- Rather than using the img element, web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align images. <br>
The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image. <br>
New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align images to the left or right of the page. 
- By default, images are inline elements. This means they flow within the surrounding text. In order to to center an image, it should be turned into a block level element using the display property with a value of block. 
- Once made into a block-level element, there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image: <br>
1: on the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
2: on the image itself, you can use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.
- You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
- To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.
