 ## Read: 02 - jQuery, Events, and The DOM

 ### JQUERY
 - jQuery is a JavaScipt file that you include in your web pages. It lets you find elements using CSS-style selectors and then do something witht the elements using jQuery methods. It also offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all browsers without any fallback code needed.
 - A function called jQuery() lets you find one or more elements in the page. It creates an onject called jquery which holds the references to those elements. <br>
 jQuery selectors perform a similar task to traditional DOM queries, but the syntax is simple.
 - You can store jQuery object in a variable, just as you can with DOM nodes.
 - You can use jQuery methods and properties to manipulate the DOM nodes that you select.
 Basic Selectors
 <!-- - * All elemets  -->
element: All elements with that element name
#id: Elements whose id attribute has the value specified 
.class: Elements whose class attribute has the value specified
selector1, selector2: Elements that match more than one selector (see also the.add() method, whcih is more efficient when combining selections.)
- jQuery CSS style selector syntax majes ut easier to select elements to work with. It also has methods that make it easier to traverse the DOM.
- jQuery makes it easier to handle events because the event methods work across all browsers.

### Six reasons for Pair Programming 
- Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. <br>
The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
- There are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: 
Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful. <br>
Six reasons 
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
