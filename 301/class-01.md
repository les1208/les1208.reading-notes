## SMACSS and Responsive Web Design
<!-- https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design/ -->
  Responsive design websites continually and fluidly change based on different factors, such as viewport width, while adaptive websites are built to a group of preset factors. 

Resposive web design is broken down into three main components.<br>
 - First one being flexible layouts, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units. These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding.
 - Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles. Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example. <br> 
 using the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet, importing a new style sheet using the @import rule, or by linking to a separate style sheet from within the HTML document
 - flexible media As viewports begin to change size media doesnâ€™t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes.
