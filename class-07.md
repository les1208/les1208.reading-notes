### Tables

- When representing information in a table, you need to think in terms of a grid made up of rows and columns. <br>
Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. In HTML a table is written out row by row. <br>
the < table > element is use to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row. < tr > you indicate the start of each row using the opening tr tag. TR stands for table row. It is followed by one or more < td > elements (one for each cell in that row). At the end of the row you use a closing tr tag.
- Each cell of a table is represented using a < td > element. 
- The TH element is used just like th TD element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. If a cell has no content you should still use a TD or TH element to represent the presence of an empty cell otherwise the table will not render correctly. 
- Colspan attribute can be used on TH or TD element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.

### Functions, Methods, & Objects

- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
- Functions can take parameters(information required to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
- Web browserrs implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
- Javascript also has several build-in objects such as string, number, math, and date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
