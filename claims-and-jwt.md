### Claims-based authorization in ASP.NET Core
- When an identity is created it may be assigned one or more claims issued by a trusted party. A claim is a name value pair that represents what the subject is, not what the subject can do.
- Claims based authorization, at its simplest, checks the value of a claim and allows access to a resource based upon that value
- An identity can contain multiple claims with multiple values and can contain multiple claims of the same type.
#### Adding claims checks
- Claim based authorization checks are declarative - the developer embeds them within their code, against a controller or an action within a controller, specifying claims which the current user must possess, and optionally the value the claim must hold to access the requested resource. Claims requirements are policy based, the developer must build and register a policy expressing the claims requirements.
- The simplest type of claim policy looks for the presence of a claim and doesn't check the value.
- First you need to build and register the policy. This takes place as part of the Authorization service configuration, which normally takes part in ConfigureServices() in your Startup.cs file.

#### Introduction to Authentication with ASP.NET Core
##### The difference between Authentication and Authorisation
- First of all, we should clarify the difference between these two dependent facets of security. The simple answer is that Authentication is the process of determining who you are, while Authorisation revolves around what you are allowed to do, i.e.

##### Authentication in ASP.NET Core
- The fundamental properties associated with identity have not really changed in ASP.NET Core - although they are different, they should be familiar to ASP.NET developers in general. For example, in ASP.NET 4.x, there is a property called User on HttpContext, which is of type IPrincipal, which represents the current user for a request. In ASP.NET Core there is a similar property named User, the difference being that this property is of type ClaimsPrincipal, which implements IPrincipal.

#####  Claims-based authentication
- The concept of claims-based authentication can be a little confusing when you first come to it, but in practice it is probably very similar to approaches you are already using. You can think of claims as being a statement about, or a property of, a particular identity. That statement consists of a name and a value. For example you could have a DateOfBirth claim, FirstName claim, EmailAddress claim or IsVIP claim. Note that these statements are about what or who the identity is, not what they can do.

- The identity itself represents a single declaration that may have many claims associated with it. For example, consider a driving license. This is a single identity which contains a number of claims - FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, Address and which vehicles you are allowed to drive. Your passport would be a different identity with a different set of claims.

### What is JWT?
- JSON Web Token (JWT) is a means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS) and/or encrypted using JSON Web Encryption (JWE).
- In simple terms, it is just another way of encoding JSON object and use that encoded object as access tokens for authentication from the server.

##### Producer and Consumer concept of APIâ€™s ðŸ˜Ž
There are two parties involved, one party who gives a service, and the other party who uses the service.
Producer is the one who gives a service. It will be the provider(Server) of the API(s) which are JWT protected.
Consumer is the one who uses it. It will be the customer(Server/Mobile App/ Web App/ Client) who will be providing the valid JWT token to consume the API(s) being provided by the Producer.
