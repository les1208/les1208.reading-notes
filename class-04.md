## Images

- < img > element is used to add images to a web page and it must carry the two following attributes: 
src tells the browser where it can find the image file. 
- alt  provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it. 
You can use title attribute with img element to provide additional information about image. 
- img element will also use two other attributes that specify the size: height and width which specify size in pixels.
- Where you place the img in the code is important because browsers show HTML elements in on of two ways: 
- block elements always appear on a new line. ex: h1 and p elements.
- inline elements sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line. ex: b, em, and img elements.
- three rules to remember when you are creating images. Save images in the right format, save images at the right size, and use the correct resolution.
- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs.

## Color

- You can specify color in CSS one of three ways:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names. 
- When picking foreground and background colors, ensure that there is enough contrast for text to be legible.
-CSS3 has introduces an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity, known as RGBA.

## Text

- The font family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies. 
- The font size property enables you to specify a size for the font.
- You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words, text can also be aligned to the left, right, and center, or justified. It can also be indented. 
- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over.
