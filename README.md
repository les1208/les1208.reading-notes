- CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. 
A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

# Read: 03 - HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow
### Lists
- Ordered lists are list where each item in the list is numbered. < ol > element
- Unoredred lists are list that begin with a bulled point.
- Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitons for each of those terms. Inside the < dl > element you will usually see pairs of < dt > and < dd > elements. < dt > is used to cotain the term being defined (the definiton term). < dd > this is used to contain the definiton.
- Each item in the list is placed between an opening < li > tag and a closing tag.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.
### Boxes
- The most popular way to specify the size of a bx are to use pixels, percentages, or ems. When you use percentages the size of the box is relative to size of browser window or, if the box is encased within another box, it is . percentage of the size of the containing box.
- Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance: * Border: every box has a border. The border seperated the edge of one box from another.
* Margin: Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
* Padding: padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.
- Border-width propert is used to cotrol the width of a border. The value of this property can either be given in pixels or using one of the following values: thin, medium, thick
-You can control the individual size of borders using four seperate properties: top-width, right-width, bottom-width, and left-width.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
### Decisions & Loops
- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and do...while. Each repeats a set of statements.
